    Authentication is the process of determining a user's identity. Authorization is the process of determining whether
    a user has access to a resource. In ASP.NET Core, authentication is handled by the IAuthenticationService, which is
    used by authentication middleware. The authentication service uses registered authentication handlers to complete
    authentication-related actions. Examples of authentication-related actions include: Authenticating a user.
    Responding when an unauthenticated user tries to access a restricted resource. The registered authentication
    handlers and their configuration options are called "schemes". Authentication schemes are specified by registering
    authentication services in Startup.ConfigureServices: By calling a scheme-specific extension method after a call to
    services.AddAuthentication (such as AddJwtBearer or AddCookie, for example). These extension methods use
    AuthenticationBuilder.AddScheme to register schemes with appropriate settings. Less commonly, by calling
    AuthenticationBuilder.AddScheme directly. Authentication is the process of determining a user's identity.
